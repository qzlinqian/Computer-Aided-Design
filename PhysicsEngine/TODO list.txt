writeup.txt#        -- Description of your project and implementation.

src/physics/        == Project-specific files.
    body*           -- contains the parent class for physical bodies
    collisions#     -- contains functions for detecting collisions                  Completed   Not tested
    main            -- contains main function for project
    physics#        -- contains the physics object which contains all physical
                        objects and updates everything. Must edit to implement
                        RK4 for spheres.
    planebody*      -- contains the planebody class. Mostly just a container
    spherebody#     -- contains the spherebody class. Must edit to do step and
                        application of forces
    spring#         -- contains the spring class. Must edit so that it applies      Completed
                        spring forces to objects
    trianglebody*   -- contains the trianglebody class. Like the planebody class
                        it is mostly just a container

src/application/    == General application files. You can ignore all of it.
    application     -- SDL backend, runs main loop.
    camera_roam     -- camera controller
    imageio         -- used for outputting images
    opengl          -- Header to include correct OpenGL headers.
    scene_loader    -- Code to load a scene from a file.

src/math/           == Math utilities.
    camera          -- Camera class with functions to mutate.
    color           -- A class for RGB colors and related functions.
    math            -- Basic header and a few generic functions.
    matrix          -- 3D, 4D matrix classes and several related functions.
    quaternion      -- Quaternion class and several related functions--very
                        useful for 3D rotations.
    vector          -- 2D, 3D, 4D vector classes and many related functions.

src/scene/          == Scene-specific files and rendering. You can ignore all
                        of this (mostly the same as raytracer scene files)

src/tinyxml/         == XML parser
    ...             -- Don't worry about it, you'll be better off
